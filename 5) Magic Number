The Mystery of the Magic Number
In a bustling city, a famous inventor named Leo discovered an ancient artifact with a special code. To unlock its secrets, Leo needed to determine if a number was a "magic number." According to the artifact, a magic number has a unique property: it is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.
For example, the number 153 is a magic number because:
It has 3 digits.
Each digit is raised to the power of 3: 1^3, 5^3, 3^3.
The sum is 1+125+27=153, which matches the original number.
Leo was curious about a number he found: 9474. To unlock the artifact, he needed to find out if 9474 was a magic number
