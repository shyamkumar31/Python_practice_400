In India, precipitation is measured using a rain gauge in millimetre per hour.

Kavi categorises rainfall as:

    LIGHT, if rainfall is less than 3 millimetre per hour.
    MODERATE, if rainfall is greater than equal to 3 millimetre per hour and less than 7 millimetre per hour.
    HEAVY if rainfall is greater than equal to 7 millimetre per hour.

Given that it rains at X millimetre per hour on a day, find whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.
Input Format

    The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
    Each test case consists of a single integer X — the rate of rainfall in millimetre per hour.

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.

You may print each character in lowercase or uppercase. For example, LIGHT, light, Light, and liGHT, are all identical.

Example :
Input :
4
1
20
3
7
Output :
LIGHT

HEAVY
Constraints
1≤T≤20
1≤X≤20

code:-

T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    x=int(input())
    if x<3:
        print("LIGHT")
    elif x>=3 and x<7:
        print("MODERATE")
    else:
        print("HEAVY")
