Solomon was driving on a highway at a speed of X km/hour.

To avoid accidents, there are fine imposed on overspeeding as follows:

    No fine if the speed of the car ≤70 km/hour.
    Rs 500 fine if the speed of the car is strictly greater than 70 and ≤100
    Rs 2000 fine if the speed of the car is strictly greater than 100

Determine the fine Solomon needs to pay.
Input Format

    The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
    Each test case consists of a single integer X denoting the speed of Solomon's car.
