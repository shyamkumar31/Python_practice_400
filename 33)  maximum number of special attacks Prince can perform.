Program - 33 / 400


Solo is playing a mobile game. In the game, Solo's character Prince can perform special attacks. However, one special attack costs X mania points to Prince.

If Prince currently has Y mania points, determine the maximum number of special attacks he can perform.
Input Format

    The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
    The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y — the cost of one special attack and the number of mania points Prince has initially.

Output Format

For each test case, output the maximum number of special attacks Prince can perform.

Example :
Input :
3
10 30
6 41
50 2
Output :
3
6
0

code:-

import math
T=int(int(input()))
for i in range(T):
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    if x<y:
        print(math.floor(y/x))
    else:
        print(0)
