Program - 31 / 400

Alice and Bob are very good friends and they always distribute all the eatables equally among themselves.

Alice has A chocolates and Bob has B chocolates. Determine whether Alice and Bob can distribute all the chocolates equally among themselves.

Note that:

    It is not allowed to break a chocolate into more than one piece.
    No chocolate shall be left in the distribution.

Input Format

    The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B, the number of chocolates that Alice and Bob have, respectively.

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line YES if Alice and Bob can distribute all the chocolates equally, else output NO. 

Example :
Input :
4
1 1
1 3
1 2
1 4
Output :
YES
YES
NO
NO

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤A,B≤10^5


code:-

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    A, B = map(int, input().split())
    if (A + B) % 2 == 0:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
