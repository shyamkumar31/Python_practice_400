Write a Python program named is_prime that takes an integer as input and returns True if the number is a prime number, and False otherwise.
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are prime numbers.

Example Logic:
To check if a number is prime, follow these steps:
If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number.
For numbers greater than 1, check if the number can be divided evenly by any integer from 2 up to the square root of the number (inclusive).
If any of these divisions result in a whole number, the number is not prime.
If no such divisor is found, the number is prime.

code:-

n=int(input())
if n<=1:
    print(False)
else:
    for i in range(2,int(n**0.5)):
        if n%i==0:
            print(False)
            break
    else:
        print(True)
